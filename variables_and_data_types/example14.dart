  /// Conventions for writing variable names

  ///  lower case and then the next word with upper case
  /// 2. Use nouns for variable names : This is because we are naming a thing
  /// 3. Use descriptive names : This is because we want to know what the variable is
  /// 4. Use final or const for values that never change : This is because we want to
  /// avoid reassigning the value
  /// 5. Use uppercase for constant names : This is because we want to differentiate 
  /// between the variables and constants
  /// 6. Use underscores to separate words : This is because we want to differentiate
  /// between the words
  /// 7. Don't start names with symbols : This is because we want to avoid confusion
  /// 8. Don't start names with numbers : This is because we want to avoid confusion
  /// 9. Don't use keywords : This is because we want to avoid confusion
  /// 10. Don't use dart core library names : This is because we want to avoid confusion
  /// 11. Don't use type annotations unless necessary : This is because we want to avoid
  /// confusion. 
  /// 12. Dart is a type safe language which means that it will automatically
  /// infer the data type of the variable
